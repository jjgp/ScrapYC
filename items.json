We're building Heroku in your own cloud. We let users link up their own AWS/GCP, point to the code they want to run, and then put the rest of the hosting process on autopilot (CI/CD, SSL, autoscaling, zero downtime deploys, infra monitoring, etc).</p><p>We're hiring engineers that are passionate about building tools for developers. If you have some experience with either Typescript or Go, or you're very interested in this space, we'd love to talk with you. As we're a fast-growing seed-stage startup, you should be comfortable with regularly shifting priorities and iterating at a very high (daily) velocity.</p><p>Some of the technical challenges we face:</p><p>* Abstracting Kubernetes - any PaaS spans a variety of use cases, so building a consistent and useful layer of abstraction requires constant awareness of the needs of many user profiles.</p><p>* Cloud Agnosticism - one of Porter's main benefits is that you get the same interface for managing services regardless of where you host. Our job is to reduce multi-cloud infrastructure complexity to a unified interface.</p><p>* Auto-Generated Frontend - each of our app/add-on templates uses a form.yaml file that programmatically generates a settings UI on the dashboard using a library of our own input primitives. Designing, expanding, and testing the functionality of these templates is non-trivial.</p><p>Please apply by sending an email to jobs [at] porter [dot] run or applying through <a href=\"https://www.workatastartup.com/jobs/43716\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.workatastartup.com/jobs/43716</a>.</p></span>"},

We don't hire for this team very often, but we're looking to hire a couple of people now.  Several of the people we've hired have come from prior monthly Who's Hiring threads.</p><p>This is a great role for somebody who loves startups and is interested in being part of the YC startup community, and wants to own projects from start-to-finish.</p><p>It could also be a great role for someone who's interested in doing a startup in the future (though that's certainly not a requirement). If you're interested in getting funded by YC as a founder in the future, but you don't have a startup that's ready for that yet, joining the YC software team could be a great step. Several former software team members are now running YC startups.</p><p>We work primarily in Ruby on Rails and React (learning on the job is fine though), and we spend most of our time coding. That said, we encourage everyone to participate in all of YC -- read applications, join our batch talks, help out with Demo Day and speak up on the projects you'd want to work on.</p><p>The software team you'd be joining has about ten people with lots of collective years of start-up and big company experience, so you'll get the best of both worlds: moving fast and shipping and strong teammates/mentors to help you learn. About half of us are YC alums and several of us are parents. We're open to people 2+ years out of school or with 10+ years of experience. Lastly, the work-life balance and compensation are great, and you get to work with people across the company.</p><p>YC is fully remote and is hiring people anywhere in the US.  We plan to reopen optional, part-time in-person offices in the SF Bay Area in the future for employees in the area.</p><p>There are two specific product teams we're hiring for at the moment.  The first is <a href=\"https://www.startupschool.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.startupschool.org/</a>, which is the world's largest course about startups.  The second is the YC admissions team, which is the team that builds software that helps us decide which startups to invest in.</p><p>If that sounds interesting, apply below or email me: jared@ycombinator.com</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/careers?ashby_jid=97a2711c-1f0d-4ff7-9be7-b2cf9100d3cb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ycombinator.com/careers?ashby_jid=97a2711c-1f0d-...</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/careers?ashby_jid=ef00c8d1-76e7-4cc3-82fe-7cc3e4679652\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ycombinator.com/careers?ashby_jid=ef00c8d1-76e7-...</a></p></span>"},

A small pivot in our journey has led to a strong product-market fit and we are moving quickly to build something incredible.</p><p>If you own a building with leases to tenants, you need insurance - whether the economy is growing or not. It is also an industry that has not evolved to use modern technology: workflows are manual, communication is messy and time-consuming, and people often don't know what they're buying or why they're buying it. Obie sells commercial real estate insurance in a new way: one that emphasizes transparency and human-centric automation.</p><p>We are a venture-backed technology company. Our early success is in large part due to our unwavering standards in hiring. We recognize that our product is only as good as the people building and promoting it. We look for individuals who find solutions by going through the cycle of ideation to implementation with curiosity, rigor and a highly analytical lens.</p><p>At Obie, we judge people based on the merit of their work. If you are passionate about what this role entails, are excited by solving real problems, and you want to help shape the future of commercial real estate, we want to hear from you.</p><p>We're based in Chicago, have an office in Florida, and remote employees across the US and Canada.</p><p>We welcome US/Canadian based remote applicants, but be warned: we'll try to persuade you to move to the City by the Lake.</p><p>Email me directly for more info or to set up a chat!

This gives everyone from the CEO to the individual contributor a shared understanding of how the business works, where you\u2019re going, and why. With this new context, your team can engage in higher-level conversations about what\u2019s right for the company. Together, you can easily explore which levers to pull and find out, in real-time, if doing so will help you meet your goals.<p>Runway does all of this in a way that makes you want to dig into the data \u2014 not run away from it \u2014 through a fundamental rethinking of the core primitives of the spreadsheet. Because when you have the information you need, your team can ask better questions and make the best decisions possible.</p><p>We\u2019ve put together an exceptional team of ex-Stri\u00e5pe, Coinbase, Facebook, and Twitter engineers, many of whom are experienced founders.

That should give you an idea both about how seriously we take technology and the culture of the firm.</p><p>We are five years into a period of transformation from what was initially a fairly standard enterprise finance technology approach to something new that recognises the importance of both the humane and the technical for discretionary portfolio management and for the business of running an alternative investment manager.  [Amaury Sechet](<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhR4PSExnqk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhR4PSExnqk</a>) and [Atila Neves](<a href=\"https://dlang.org/blog/2019/10/15/my-vision-of-ds-future/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dlang.org/blog/2019/10/15/my-vision-of-ds-future/</a>) have been working with us as long-term consultants and we have many other talented people with lower public profiles.</p><p>It's not easy to integrate practitioners who may spend most of their day programming, but are oriented towards solving business problems, with developers who are specialists in programming. To achieve this, we wrote a little functional DSL that's now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it. SIL can compile and call C++, D, and C# at runtime and interoperate with Python and R. What might be a project in itself elsewhere can be just a set of functions in Symmetry Integration Language.</p><p>The language is written in D and we have a close involvement with the D Foundation and community, hosting DConf in London.  So we are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D as well as people to work with practitioners writing Symmetry Integration Language. Also looking for people to write documentation and work on the build.</p><p>It's quite a creative place where we encourage a degree of courage amidst practical constraints, and we are open to doing things a different way if it's commercially sound and in the interests of our investors.</p><p>We look for virtues and capabilities over only experience and credentials although those things aren't a disadvantage. Do not let a lack of credentials or qualifications prevent you from applying. We've recently hired experts with C++, Common Lisp, D, Haxe, Haskell, Julia and Perl backgrounds, and are happy to bring them up to speed with the tools we use.</p><p>Compensation is currently not quite at Netflix standards but is generous to very generous over time by broad technology industry standards. We recognise and reward technical accomplishment and have a very flat structure - don't be surprised if our founder and Chief Investment Officer starts asking you questions about your work.</p><p>## Symmetry Talks</p><p>- Presenting SIL-cling to Compiler Research Group at Princeton (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/7teqrCNzrD8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/7teqrCNzrD8</a>)</p><p>- Symmetry Internship Project - calling C++ from SIL (<a href=\"http://dconf.org/2020/online/index.html#alexandru\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dconf.org/2020/online/index.html#alexandru</a>)</p><p>- All Spreadsheets Must Die (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/FZi9CSB9_kk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/FZi9CSB9_kk</a>)</p><p>- Lessons from a DSL where all you have is Ranges (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtuzSlKRmzA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtuzSlKRmzA</a>)</p><p>- Alternative Investment Management (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/1rMq-4rWgis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/1rMq-4rWgis</a>)</p><p>## Links</p><p>- Symmetry GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/symmetryinvestments\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/symmetryinvestments</a>)</p><p># Contact</p><p>- Please apply using this link (<a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/symmetryinvestments/c8a9b95e-bdf0-459c-a79f-120acdffbd0b?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jobs.lever.co/symmetryinvestments/c8a9b95e-bdf0-459c...</a>).</p></span>"},

The mission of the ZAIS Technology Team is to support asset management efforts by ingesting and managing financial data; developing tools to analyze, view, and understand that data; and automating manual processes around the firm.</p><p>About the Position</p><p>ZAIS is hiring a junior engineer to work on several of our internal web applications. These applications enable our analysts to better understand our current assets and evaluate new assets which we could add to our portfolio. You will contribute to our \u201cLoanz\u201d platform, which will allow analysts to view the complex data underlying our collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) as well as see CLO test results, evaluate hypothetical CLOs, and perform portfolio optimization. You\u2019ll also help us develop a system to model CLO performance using Monte Carlo simulations.</p><p>You will be working in a small, cross-functional team with remote members distributed across the US and Canada (with a concentration around our headquarters in Holmdel, NJ). We are a small company, which means that you will be wearing a lot of hats \u2013 we are all generalists doing whatever it takes to provide value to the business. Our team also values feedback and knowledge transfer; we work to provide these through code review, pair programming, and informal technical presentations. Here are some of the technologies you will be working with: TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, Python, Flask, Apache Airflow, Docker, Microsoft Azure.</p><p>Our Ideal Candidate</p><p>Generally speaking, we're after individuals who are driven by an insatiable desire to learn and grow. ZAIS specializes in the management of complex financial instruments, and we need engineers who are interested in the details and always want to learn more. If you only want to work in a simple business domain, then this is not the right place for you. But if you want to challenge yourself to learn about tech and finance while surrounded by a talented, multidisciplinary team, then you will fit right in.</p><p>As we are looking for a junior engineer, we expect that you have 1-3 years of professional software development experience through full-time work or internships. Ideally, you'll have worked on web applications before, but if you're comfortable writing software in a language like Python or TypeScript, and have a curious mind, you'll pick things up no problem. We would prefer you also have a 4-year degree in a technical area such as Computer Science, Mathematics, or Physics.</p><p>How to Apply</p><p>Send your resume along with a short cover letter to tech.careers@zaisgroup.com. Tell us why you'd like to work here and what the company would be like if you were in it. If you've worked on any similar projects before, then we would love to hear about them. Also, if you get the job, what would you be most interested in working on first? Don't feel the need to draft an essay. A handful of paragraphs combined with your resume is just fine.</p></span>"},

They started a background check and, unfortunately, I failed it because they found discrepancies between my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the things I said during the interviews, and the employment contracts I submitted to HireRight (the company running the background check).</p><p>During the interviews, I talked about all the things I did at Company (A) when in reality all legal documents and paystubs said that I was (supposedly) working for Company (B), which may be true depending on how you look at it.</p><p>Obviously, I explained that Company (B) was simply an intermediary, and that all work I did was for Company (A).
